raytracer
=========

A Ray Tracer I wrote from scratch using C++.

Features:
=========
* Diffuse Shading
* Flat Shading

Check the Renders folder for pictures that were generated by this ray tracer renderer.

* Scene customization
I built a custom scene customization engine, which parses through custom script files to set up light, object and camera locations/materials, etc.

* Practiced many design patterns in order to make the app easy to expand and manage like Singletons, Factories, etc.
